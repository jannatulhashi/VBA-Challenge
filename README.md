# Stock Market Data Analysis

## Background
As I progress towards becoming a programmer and Excel expert, I've undertaken a challenge to use VBA scripting to analyze stock market data.

### Objective
Develop a VBA script that efficiently processes and analyzes stock market data across multiple sheets. This script will focus on key metrics such as yearly price changes, percentage changes, and total stock volume. Additionally, it identifies stocks with the greatest percentage increase, decrease, and total trading volume.

### Purpose
The creation of the VBA script aims to provide a comprehensive tool for automating the analysis of stock market trends. This tool is designed to save significant time and offer valuable insights into stock performance, assisting in more informed investment decision-making.

### Instructions

- Create a script that loops through all stocks for one year, outputting the following information:
  - The ticker symbol
  - Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of the year to the closing price at the end of that year
  - The percentage change from opening to closing price
  - The total stock volume of the stock
  
  The results should match the following image:

- Enhance the script to identify the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". The output should resemble the following image:

![Hard Solution](Images/hard_solution.jpg)

- Adjust the VBA script to enable it to run across every worksheet (i.e., every year) simultaneously.

### Outcomes
- **Ticker AAR:** Demonstrated the greatest price increase (+22.95%), indicating strong performance and potential for further growth. Investors might consider buying or holding.
- **Ticker AYO:** Exhibited a significant decrease (-52.67%), presenting a potential risk. This might lead investors to sell or avoid, depending on their recovery assessment.
- **Ticker AUE:** Achieved the greatest total volume, suggesting high interest, possibly due to positive news or speculation, and warrants further investigation by investors.

### Recommendation
Considering the inherent risks of the stock market, it's crucial to take into account overall market conditions, personal investment goals, and risk tolerance. Therefore, consulting with a financial advisor before making any buy or sell decisions is strongly recommended.

**Note:**
Ensure to use conditional formatting that highlights positive changes in green and negative changes in red.

#### Other Considerations
During development, I used the `alphabetical_testing.xlsx` sheet for faster testing. This dataset is smaller and allows for quicker tests. Ensure the script performs consistently across all sheets. VBA automates repetitive tasks efficiently with just a button click.
